# Genetic Algorithm Lab
<p>This project is in its infancy, and the goal is to build a laboratory for genetic algorithm experiments. The goal of this project is to create an environment
where it is possible to test various options of fitness functions, chromosome configuration and solution space modeling and try to apply them to different problems.</p>

<p>The first step is to try to find solutions to well known math problems to validate the algorithms as a good option to solve them and then start applying to other not so easy problems and analyze the proposed solutions. </p>
